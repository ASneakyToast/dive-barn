                        Nestled in the rolling hills of Mendocino County, Yorkville Schoolhouse Ranch spans 2,000 acres of pristine California landscape. This historic property serves as the perfect backdrop for Dive Barn's annual gathering, where art, music, and community come together under endless skies.

                        The ranch combines natural beauty with rich history, offering festival-goers a unique experience far from the noise of urban life. Ancient oak trees, rolling meadows, and historic structures—including a one-room schoolhouse from the 1860s and a tobacco barn from the 1800s—create an atmosphere that's both timeless and magical.

                            The tobacco barn was built sometime in the 1800s and was used as a tobacco drying barn by a Hopland cigar company. After the cigar company closed, it was repurposed as a hop drying barn, reflecting the changing agricultural needs of the region.

                            The one-room schoolhouse was built in the early 1860s on land donated by prominent early settler Silas E. Gaskill, who was considered one of the valley's "best citizens." The original location was just across the highway from the entrance to the Jim Hill Ranch.

                            In a dramatic turn of events, Silas E. Gaskill was arrested on suspicion of murder in 1865. He was released on his own recognizance for $1,000, but forfeited the bail, fled the country, and was never heard from again—leaving behind one of the valley's enduring mysteries.

                        <p class="history__description">
                            Glenn Johnson began building the 2,000-acre ranch in 1919 by acquiring and combining smaller properties and homesteads. Later, his son Stanley continued expanding the operation. The Johnsons ran sheep and cattle on the ranch until Stanley retired in 2008, ending nearly 90 years of family stewardship.

                            The schoolhouse was moved to its current location in 1926 and continued to serve as the Yorkville grammar and middle school until 1947, when California passed a law requiring all schools to have flush toilets—marking the end of its educational era.

                            Peter and Mimi Buckley purchased the ranch from the Johnsons in 2012, renaming it The Acorn Ranch. The Buckleys imported a herd of Cinta Senese pigs from Italy—a rare and ancient Tuscan breed prized by charcuterie makers—and raised them on the property.
