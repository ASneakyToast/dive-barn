                            The one-room schoolhouse, currently residing on the south-east side of the property, was built in the early 1860s on land donated by prominent early settler Silas E. Gaskill. The original location was just across the highway from the entrance to the Jim Hill Ranch.

                            In a dramatic turn of events, Silas E. Gaskill was arrested on suspicion of murder in 1865. He was released on his own recognizance for $1,000, but forfeited the bail, fled the country, and was never heard from again—leaving behind one of the valley's enduring mysteries.

                        <p class="history__description">
                            Glenn Johnson began building the 2,000-acre ranch in 1919 by acquiring and combining smaller properties and homesteads. Later, his son Stanley continued expanding the operation. The Johnsons ran sheep and cattle on the ranch until Stanley retired in 2008, ending nearly 90 years of family stewardship.

                        <p class="history__description">
                            The schoolhouse was moved to its current location in 1926 and continued to serve as the Yorkville grammar and middle school until 1947, when California passed a law requiring all schools to have flush toilets—marking the end of its educational era.

                        <p class="history__description">
                            Peter and Mimi Buckley purchased the ranch from the Johnsons in 2012, renaming it The Acorn Ranch. The Buckleys imported a herd of Cinta Senese pigs from Italy—a rare and ancient Tuscan breed prized by charcuterie makers—and raised them on the property. However, some pigs escaped and bred with wild boars, contributing to Northern California's wild pig population. These are the pigs you may encounter on the property today.
